# Reflection 1

Having not ever to touch the java programming language, experiencing 
it for the first time seems so new and unique to me.

I've tried to implement the code as clean as possible, but mistakes are inevitable.
My code is ran successfully, I might not implement the best practice but it works.

As I am concerned, so far through my lens I couldn't find mistakes that
causes my program to malfunction. Thus, I am very interested to hear words
from the teaching assistant team regarding my work. Thanks
